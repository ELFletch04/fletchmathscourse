                <div>
                    <h3>An Introduction to Quadratics</h3>
                    <p>A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of the second degree, having the general form:</p>
                    <p>\[ax^2 + bx + c = 0\] where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants, and \(a \neq 0\).</p>
                    <p>Graphically, a quadratic equation produces a parabola. Here is an example:</p>
                    <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/io7a89qaa1?embed" width="200" height="200" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    <p>For instance, the quadratic equation \[2x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0\] can be graphed as shown.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Solving Quadratic Equations</h3>
                    <p>There are four main methods for solving quadratic equations:</p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                        <li>Factorising</li>
                        <li>Completing the square</li>
                        <li>The quadratic formula</li>
                        <li>Scientific calculator</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each method has its advantages and is suited to different types of quadratic equations. We will explore each method, but before doing so let's see how we can speed
                        up the process, by determining the number of roots (or solutions) an equation has before attampting to solve it, using something called the discriminant.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Discriminant:</h4>
<p>The discriminant is part of the quadratic formula and provides insight into the roots of the quadratic equation:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Two Distinct Real Roots:</strong> If \( b^2 - 4ac > 0 \), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.</li>
    <li><strong>One Repeated Real Root:</strong> If \( b^2 - 4ac = 0 \), the quadratic equation has one repeated real root.</li>
    <li><strong>No Real Roots (Complex Roots):</strong> If \( b^2 - 4ac < 0 \), the quadratic equation has no real roots.</li>
</ul>

                    <h4>1. Factorising</h4>
                    <p>Factorising involves rewriting the quadratic equation from the form \[ax^2 + bx + c = 0\] into \[(px + m)(qx + n) = 0\], where \(p\), \(q\), \(m\), and \(n\) are constants.</p>
                    <p>Once in factorised form, set each bracket equal to zero and solve for \(x\). This method is useful for finding the roots of the equation.</p>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Factorise and solve \[x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\]</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                    <p>To factorise \[x^2 + 5x + 6\], find two numbers that multiply to \(6\) and add up to \(5\). These numbers are \(2\) and \(3\), so:</p>
                    <p>\[x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)\]</p>
                    <p>Setting each bracket to zero gives:</p>
                    <p>\[x + 2 = 0 \implies x = -2\]</p>
                    <p>\[x + 3 = 0 \implies x = -3\]</p>
                    <p>The solutions are \(x = -2\) and \(x = -3\).</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Another Example:</strong> Factorise and solve \[2x^2 + 7x + 3 = 0\]</p>
                    <p>For equations where \(a \neq 1\), trial and error may help:</p>
                    <p>Assume the factorised form is \[(2x + a)(x + b)\]. We need \(a \times b = 3\) and coefficients to match. Trying \(a = 1\) and \(b = 3\) or \(a = 3\) and \(b = 1\), we find:</p>
                    <p>\[2x^2 + 7x + 3 = (2x + 1)(x + 3)\]</p>
                    <p>Solving this gives:</p>
                    <p>\[2x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -\frac{1}{2}\]</p>
                    <p>\[x + 3 = 0 \implies x = -3\]</p>
                    <p>The solutions are \(x = -\frac{1}{2}\) and \(x = -3\).</p>

                    <h4>2. Completing the Square</h4>
                    <p>Completing the square is a method used to solve quadratic equations and to find the vertex of a parabola. Hereâ€™s how you can complete the square using the method where you halve the coefficient of \(x\) and subtract its square:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Start with the standard form:</strong> Begin with the equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). If \(a \neq 1\), divide through by \(a\) to make the coefficient of \(x^2\) equal to 1.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rearrange:</strong> Move the constant term \(c\) to the other side of the equation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Halve the coefficient of \(x\):</strong> Take \(\frac{b}{2}\), square it, and add and subtract this value on the left-hand side of the equation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rewrite and solve:</strong> Rearrange and solve for \(x\).</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Solve \[x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0\] by completing the square.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. Start with the equation:</p>
                    <p>\[x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0\]</p>
                    
                    <p>2. Move the constant term to the other side:</p>
                    <p>\[x^2 + 6x = -5\]</p>
                    
                    <p>3. Halve the coefficient of \(x\), which is 6. Half of 6 is 3. This value goes into the bracket as \(x + 3\). Square this number to get 9. To complete the square, subtract this squared value (9) on the left-hand side of the equation and adjust the constant term on the right-hand side. This transforms the equation into the following form:</p>

                    <p>\[(x + 3)^2 - 9 = -5\]</p>
                    
                   <p>What we've done is transform the equation into a form that is much easier to manipulate and solve. The trick of halving the coefficient of \(x\) and subtracting its square will work every time, provided the coefficient of \(x^2\) in the original equation is 1.</p>

                    
                    <p>4. Simplify the equation by moving -9 to the right side:</p>
                    <p>\[(x + 3)^2 = 4\]</p>
                    
                    <p>5. Solve for \(x\) by taking the square root of both sides:</p>
                    <p>\[x + 3 = \pm \sqrt{4}\]</p>
                    <p>\[x + 3 = \pm 2\]</p>
                    
                    <p>6. Isolate \(x\) to find the solutions:</p>
                    <p>\[x = -3 + 2 = -1\]</p>
                    <p>\[x = -3 - 2 = -5\]</p>
                    
                    <p>The solutions are \(x = -1\) and \(x = -5\).</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Solve \[x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0\] by completing the square.</p>
                    
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>1. Start with the equation:</p>
<p>\[x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0\]</p>
                    
<p>2. Move the constant term to the other side:</p>
<p>\[x^2 - 4x = 5\]</p>
                    
<p>3. Halve the coefficient of \(x\), which is -4. Half of -4 is -2. This value goes into the bracket as \(x - 2\). Square this number to get 4. To complete the square, subtract this squared value (4) on the left-hand side of the equation and adjust the constant term on the right-hand side. This transforms the equation into the following form:</p>

<p>\[(x - 2)^2 - 4 = 5\]</p>
                    
<p>What we've done is transform the equation into a form that is much easier to manipulate and solve. The trick of halving the coefficient of \(x\) and subtracting its square will work every time, provided the coefficient of \(x^2\) in the original equation is 1.</p>
                    
<p>4. Simplify the equation by moving -4 to the right side:</p>
<p>\[(x - 2)^2 = 9\]</p>
                    
<p>5. Solve for \(x\) by taking the square root of both sides:</p>
<p>\[x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{9}\]</p>
<p>\[x - 2 = \pm 3\]</p>
                    
<p>6. Isolate \(x\) to find the solutions:</p>
<p>\[x = 2 + 3 = 5\]</p>
<p>\[x = 2 - 3 = -1\]</p>
                    
<p>The solutions are \(x = 5\) and \(x = -1\).</p>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Solve \[2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0\] by completing the square.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>1. Start with the equation:</p>
<p>\[2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0\]</p>

<p>2. Divide the entire equation by 2 to make the coefficient of \(x^2\) equal to 1:</p>
<p>\[x^2 + \frac{5}{2}x - \frac{3}{2} = 0\]</p>

<p>3. Move the constant term to the other side:</p>
<p>\[x^2 + \frac{5}{2}x = \frac{3}{2}\]</p>

<p>4. Halve the coefficient of \(x\), which is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Half of \(\frac{5}{2}\) is \(\frac{5}{4}\). This value goes into the bracket as \(x + \frac{5}{4}\). Square this number to get \(\left(\frac{5}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{16}\). To complete the square, subtract this squared value (\(\frac{25}{16}\)) on the left-hand side of the equation and adjust the constant term on the right-hand side. This transforms the equation into the following form:</p>

<p>\[\left(x + \frac{5}{4}\right)^2 - \frac{25}{16} = \frac{3}{2}\]</p>

<p>5. Simplify the equation by moving \(-\frac{25}{16}\) to the right side. Convert \(\frac{3}{2}\) to a fraction with the same denominator (\(\frac{24}{16}\)): </p>
<p>\[\left(x + \frac{5}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{24}{16} + \frac{25}{16}\]</p>
<p>\[\left(x + \frac{5}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{49}{16}\]</p>

<p>6. Solve for \(x\) by taking the square root of both sides:</p>
<p>\[x + \frac{5}{4} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{49}{16}}\]</p>
<p>\[x + \frac{5}{4} = \pm \frac{7}{4}\]</p>

<p>7. Isolate \(x\) to find the solutions:</p>
<p>\[x = -\frac{5}{4} + \frac{7}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}\]</p>
<p>\[x = -\frac{5}{4} - \frac{7}{4} = -\frac{12}{4} = -3\]</p>

<p>The solutions are \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(x = -3\).</p>



                    
                    <h4>3. The Quadratic Formula</h4>
                    <p>The quadratic formula is used to solve any quadratic equation and is given by:</p>
                    <p>\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\]</p>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Solve \[2x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0\] using the quadratic formula.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                    <p>Here, \(a = 2\), \(b = 3\), and \(c = 1\). Plug these values into the formula:</p>
                    <p>\[x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 2}\]</p>
                    <p>\[x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}}{4}\]</p>
                    <p>\[x = \frac{-3 \pm 1}{4}\]</p>
                    <p>The solutions are:</p>
                    <p>\[x = \frac{-3 + 1}{4} = -\frac{1}{2}\]</p>
                    <p>\[x = \frac{-3 - 1}{4} = -1\]</p>

                    <h4>4. Using a Scientific Calculator</h4>
                    <p>Scientific calculators often feature a built-in quadratic solver. This function allows you to input the values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) to quickly find the roots.</p>
                    <p>While this method is fast and convenient, it may not provide much insight into the underlying techniques of solving quadratics. For a deeper understanding, itâ€™s beneficial to practice solving equations manually using other methods.</p>
                    <p>For detailed instructions on how to use the quadratic solver on your specific calculator model, refer to online guides or the user manual for your device.</p>
                    
                    <div class="exam_tip">
                        <h4>Exam Tip</h4>
                        <p>Before relying on your calculator, try to solve the quadratic equation manually using one of the other methods. This will help reinforce your understanding and ensure accuracy. If youâ€™re short on time during an exam, using the calculator can be a valuable tool. Just be sure to double-check that youâ€™ve entered the coefficients correctly to avoid any errors.</p>

                    <h2>Graphing Quadratics</h2><br><br>
                
                    <p>A quadratic equation represents a parabola when graphed. Understanding how to graph a quadratic equation involves identifying key features: the vertex, roots (x-intercepts), y-intercept, and the shape of the curve. Below, we'll walk through each of these features and use Desmos for visual demonstrations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Vertex</h3>
                    <h4>Finding the Vertex Using Completed Square Form</h4><br><br>

                    <p>Once you have rewritten a quadratic function in the completed square form, identifying the vertex is straightforward. The completed square form is:</p>
                    <p>\[ y = a(x - h)^2 + k \]</p>
    
                    <h4>Understanding the Vertex Form</h4>
                    <p>In the completed square form:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> \( (h, k) \) represents the vertex of the quadratic function.</li>
                        <li> \( h \) is the \( x \)-coordinate of the vertex, and it is found inside the parentheses. If the form is \( (x - h) \), then \( h \) is the opposite sign of what appears in the parentheses.</li>
                        <li> \( k \) is the \( y \)-coordinate of the vertex and is the constant term outside the squared term.</li>
                    </ul>
    <br>
                    <strong>Example</strong>
                    <p>Consider the quadratic function:</p>
                    <p>\[ y = 2(x + 3)^2 - 7 \]</p>
    
                    <p>This function is already in the completed square form:</p>
                    <p>\[ y = a(x - h)^2 + k \]</p>
    
                    <p>Here, \( a = 2 \), \( h = -3 \), and \( k = -7 \). Thus:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The vertex \( (h, k) \) is \( (-3, -7) \).</li>
                    </ul>
    
                    <p>So, the vertex of the quadratic function \( y = 2(x + 3)^2 - 7 \) is \( (-3, -7) \).</p>

                    <h3>2. Roots (x-intercepts)</h3>
                    <p>The roots of a quadratic equation are the values of \(x\) where the graph intersects the x-axis. These can be found by solving the quadratic equation using methods such as factorising, completing the square, or the quadratic formula.</p>
                    <p>Hereâ€™s a graph showing the roots of a quadratic equation:</p>

                    <h3>3. Y-Intercept</h3>
                    <p>The y-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis. It is found by setting \(x = 0\) in the equation \(ax^2 + bx + c\). The y-intercept is simply the constant term \(c\) in the equation.</p>
                    <p>Hereâ€™s an example showing the y-intercept of a quadratic graph:</p>

                    <h3>4. Shape of the Curve</h3>
                    <p>The shape of the parabola depends on the coefficient \(a\) in the quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c\). If \(a > 0\), the parabola opens upwards; if \(a < 0\), it opens downwards. The magnitude of \(a\) affects how "steep" the parabola is.</p>
                    <p>Visualize the effect of different values of \(a\) on the shape of the parabola:</p>

                    <h4>Example: Graphing a Quadratic</h4>
                    <p>Let's graph the quadratic equation:</p>
                    <p>\[ y = 2x^2 - 4x - 6 \]</p>
                    <p>This quadratic has a vertex, roots, and y-intercept that we can identify:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Vertex: Use the formula to find \(x\), then substitute to get the y-coordinate.</li>
                        <li>Roots: Find where the parabola intersects the x-axis.</li>
                        <li>Y-Intercept: Set \(x = 0\) and solve for \(y\).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Here is the graph of this quadratic equation:</p>
